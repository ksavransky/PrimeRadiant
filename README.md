*Welcome to Markov Chain Tweets! Markov Chain Tweets is a web application that allows you to search for a twitter user and see their latest 10 tweets! Then, using a Markov Chain algorithm, you can generate new tweets based on the text of the twitter user's real tweets. Think of it as a Mad Libs tweet maker! Additionally, you can re-order the user's last ten tweets based on a customizable Markov Chain controlled by your inputs. This provides you with a configurable example of how a Markov Chain works! Have fun playing with this application and learning about Markov Chains. Thank you!*

*This application was created using Node.js, React/Redux, Javascript ES6, Flexbox CSS, and Foundation*
